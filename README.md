# 📊 Student MLE Mini-Projects

Welcome to the **Student MLE (Machine Learning Engineer) Mini-Project Series**!  
This repository contains a curated set of hands-on Jupyter notebooks created using Google Colab, aimed at exploring core concepts in machine learning, data science, and MLOps.

Each notebook focuses on a fundamental topic and includes practical implementations using Python libraries such as `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `TensorFlow/Keras`.

## 📁 Projects Overview

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Fine Tuning** | Hyperparameter tuning using `GridSearchCV` and other model optimization techniques. |
| **Flask API Deployment** | Hosting an ML model with a simple Flask web app to demonstrate MLOps deployment. |
| **Logistic Regression** | Binary classification with logistic regression. Model evaluation includes accuracy, ROC curve, and confusion matrix. |
| **Machine Learning Pipeline** | Full ML pipeline including preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation. |
| **Recommendation Engines** | Implementation of collaborative filtering and content-based recommendation systems. |
| **Trees and Forests** | Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers with feature importance analysis. |
| **Deep Learning** | Introductory neural network model for classification using TensorFlow/Keras. |

## 🚀 Getting Started

These notebooks are designed to run in **Google Colab**. No local setup required:

1. Click on any `.ipynb` file.
2. Select **“Open in Colab”**.
3. Run the cells top to bottom.
4. Install any required libraries using `!pip install` if prompted.

## 🧰 Requirements

Most notebooks require the following Python libraries:

- `pandas`, `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- `TensorFlow/Keras` (for deep learning notebook)
- `Flask` (for the deployment notebook)
